# Advent of Code

Merry Christmas!
Advent of code is a yearly puzzle event, one puzzle each day from December 1st to December 25th.
This repo contains my solutions for past years, and support classes I used to solve the problems.

If you execute the project with the --execute argument, it will execute to latest incomplete day.  Without the argument it will promot you for a day number to execute.

## 2022

Solutions for 2022 are not all in yet, moving them into this 2023 structure one each day this advent season.
